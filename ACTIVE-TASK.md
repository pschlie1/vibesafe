---

## Objective
Make Scantient a million-dollar-looking SaaS with clear value per tier, robust tests, and professional UX.

## Phase 1: Value Proposition Audit ✅ DONE

### What Was Done
1. **Explored codebase**
   - Mapped 5 tier structure: FREE (Builder), STARTER, PRO, ENTERPRISE, ENTERPRISE_PLUS
   - Identified tier capabilities in `src/lib/tier-capabilities.ts`
   - Examined Stripe configuration and pricing in `src/lib/stripe.ts`

2. **Mapped current tiers and features**
   - **Builder (FREE):** 1 app, 1 user, daily scans, core checks only
   - **Starter ($199):** 5 apps, 2 users, 8-hour scans, governance report (unused tier)
   - **Pro ($399):** 15 apps, 10 users, 4-hour scans, API access, Jira/GitHub/Teams integrations
   - **Enterprise ($1500):** 100 apps, 50 users, 1-hour scans, SSO, PagerDuty, audit logs
   - **Enterprise Plus ($2500):** Unlimited apps (999), all features, priority support

3. **Walked through UI/UX as each persona**
   - Landing page: Clean feature cards (12 shown, 20 claimed)
   - Signup flow: Frictionless (email → verify → dashboard)
   - Results display: Clear security grade, plain-English findings
   - Dashboard: Portfolio view with status badges (Healthy/Warning/Critical)
   - Billing page: Simple plan comparison, manage billing modal
   - Mobile: Responsive, layout holds up

4. **Identified critical gaps and rough edges**
   - **4 CRITICAL BUGS blocking revenue:**
     1. ENTERPRISE_PLUS stored as ENTERPRISE in DB (customers paying $2500/mo get $1500 service)
     2. ENTERPRISE_PLUS scan interval defaults to 24h instead of 1h
     3. Jira integration completely broken (double-protocol URL)
     4. CI Scan API bypasses app count limits
   - **5 HIGH-PRIORITY issues** (tier gates, retry logic, middleware)
   - **4 MEDIUM-PRIORITY issues** (copy violations, undercooked Starter tier)

5. **Documented findings in PRODUCT-ROADMAP.md**
   - Current state analysis with tier matrix
   - Value prop per tier (what hooks customers?)
   - Critical bugs with impact + fix time estimates
   - UI/UX audit results (what's good, what needs work)
   - Competitive positioning (who we beat, why)
   - Feature gaps by tier
   - Quick wins (2.5 hours total effort)
   - Medium-term improvements (1-2 weeks each)

---

## Key Findings

### Biggest Gap
**ENTERPRISE_PLUS tier is broken.** Customers paying $2,500/month are silently stored as ENTERPRISE tier, receiving 100-app limits instead of 999, and 24-hour scan intervals instead of 1-hour. This is contractual fraud and blocks scaling beyond 1-2 enterprise deals.

### Revenue Impact
- **HIGH-RISK:** All critical bugs (CB1-4) directly affect paying customers
- **MEDIUM-RISK:** Pricing page is confusing (5 tiers), conversion rate likely low
- **LOW-RISK:** UI/UX is clean but copy needs work

### Recommendation for Phase 2
**Ship quick wins first (2.5 hours):**
1. Fix Jira integration (CB-3)
2. Fix ENTERPRISE_PLUS tier gate (CB-1 + CB-2)
3. Fix CI Scan API limit bypass (CB-4)
4. Fix trends endpoint tier gate (HP-1)
5. Fix Jira test endpoint tier gate (HP-5)

Then measure trial-to-paid conversion baseline, then ship medium-term wins.
