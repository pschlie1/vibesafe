          Scantient was founded in 2025 by a team of enterprise IT and security veterans who kept running into the same problem: employees were deploying AI-generated applications faster than IT could track them. By the time security found out, the apps were already processing customer data.
        </p>

        <div className="mt-16">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">The problem we&apos;re solving</h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 leading-relaxed text-body">
            <p>
              The rise of AI coding tools (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Replit, Bolt) has fundamentally changed how software gets built. Employees across every department now build and deploy functional applications in hours, without any developer involvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is genuinely good for productivity. It&apos;s a serious problem for security. These applications process real data, serve real users, and create real compliance obligations, but they&apos;re built without security review, code standards, or IT oversight.
            </p>
            <p>
              IT Directors call it &ldquo;shadow IT on steroids.&rdquo; We built Scantient to give them back control.
