          Ask your engineers how many AI tools they use daily. GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Codeium,
          Tabnine, Gemini, Perplexity . the list adds up fast. The average engineering team is running 10 or more.
          Now ask how many of those tools are covered by a formal usage policy. For most organizations, the answer is zero.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">The Shadow AI Problem Is Already Here</h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 leading-relaxed text-body">
            <p>
              Shadow IT . employees using unapproved software . has been a compliance headache for decades. But
              shadow AI is shadow IT on steroids. The barrier to using a new AI tool is a browser tab, not a
              software install. Engineers don&apos;t think of opening Claude.ai as a security decision. It just feels
              like using a search engine.
            </p>
            <p>
              But it&apos;s not a search engine. When an engineer pastes a function signature, a database schema, or
              a stack trace into ChatGPT to debug a production issue, that data leaves your environment. It may
              be used for model training. It&apos;s stored on servers outside your data processing agreements.
              If that code touches customer records, you may have just created a GDPR incident . without anyone
              realizing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              And that&apos;s the optimistic scenario. The pessimistic one involves credentials.

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-heading">Data Exposure</h3>
              <p className="mt-2">
                Engineers routinely paste proprietary code, internal documentation, and customer data into AI
                tools to get better answers. Most AI providers use this data to improve their models unless you
                have an enterprise plan with explicit data retention controls. The free tier of every major LLM
                almost certainly uses your data. Your engineers are almost certainly on the free tier.

            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-heading">Compliance Failures</h3>
              <p className="mt-2">
                SOC 2 requires you to maintain controls over where data goes. GDPR requires data processing
                agreements with any service that touches EU personal data. HIPAA requires Business Associate
                Agreements. None of these frameworks have a &ldquo;but we didn&apos;t know&rdquo; carve-out.
                If your engineers are using AI tools that process regulated data without appropriate agreements,
                you are already non-compliant. The audit hasn&apos;t found it yet.

              <p className="mt-2">
                When a SOC 2 auditor asks how you govern AI tool usage across your engineering team, &ldquo;we
                trust our engineers&rdquo; is not a control. Auditors want policy documentation, training
                records, monitoring evidence, and incident logs. If you&apos;re starting from zero when the
                audit begins, you&apos;re not starting from zero . you&apos;re starting from a finding.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">How to Enforce It (Without Becoming the Policy Police)</h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 leading-relaxed text-body">
            <p>
              Writing a policy is the easy part. Enforcement without surveillance theater is harder. Nobody
              wants to work at a company that monitors every browser tab. Here&apos;s what actually works:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-heading">Start with visibility, not control.</strong> Before you can
              enforce anything, you need to know what&apos;s being used. Automated scanning tools can detect
              AI tool usage patterns across your organization . which domains are being accessed, from which
              endpoints, using what credentials. This gives you a baseline without invasive monitoring.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-heading">Make compliance the path of least resistance.</strong> If
              getting an approved AI tool takes three weeks of IT tickets, engineers will use unapproved tools.
              Set up a streamlined approval process. Build a curated list of pre-approved tools that engineers
              can use immediately. Make the approved path easier than the workaround.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-heading">Automate audit trails.</strong> Continuous monitoring means you
              don&apos;t need point-in-time audits. Tools like Scantient can continuously scan for AI tool
              usage, flag policy gaps, and generate the audit evidence your compliance team needs . without
              requiring manual data collection or self-reported surveys (which are useless).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-heading">Pair detection with education.</strong> When the scanner flags
              an unapproved tool, the response shouldn&apos;t be a disciplinary action . it should be a
              conversation and a faster path to getting the tool approved. Most policy violations happen
              because engineers don&apos;t know the policy exists, not because they&apos;re trying to
              circumvent controls.
